## Important information

- We can only build `msi` packages with stable version number (no RCs, nor Nightlies).
Example of the error message when building with an RC

```
error CNDL0108 : The Product/@Version attribute's value, '3.5.1-RC1', is not a valid version.  Legal version values should look like 'x.x.x.x' where x is an integer from 0 to 65534
```
