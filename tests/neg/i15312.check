-- [E007] Type Mismatch Error: tests/neg/i15312.scala:7:27 -------------------------------------------------------------
7 |val b: F[{type A = Int}] = "asd" // error
  |                           ^^^^^
  |                           Found:    ("asd" : String)
  |                           Required: F[Object{type A = Int}]
  |
  |                           Note: a match type could not be fully reduced:
  |
  |                             trying to reduce  F[Object{type A = Int}]
  |                             failed since selector Object{type A = Int}
  |                             does not match  case Object{type A = Float} => Int
  |                             and cannot be shown to be disjoint from it either.
  |                             Therefore, reduction cannot advance to the remaining case
  |
  |                               case Object{type A = Int} => String
