   |          No given instance of type => Monad[F] was found for parameter ev of method blaMonad in object Test.
   |          I found:
   |
   |              Test.blaMonad[F², S](Test.blaMonad[F³, S²])
   |
   |          But method blaMonad in object Test does not match type => Monad[F²]
   |
   |          where:    F  is a type variable with constraint <: [_] =>> Any
   |                    F² is a type variable with constraint <: [_] =>> Any
   |                    F³ is a type variable with constraint <: [_] =>> Any
   |                    S  is a type variable
   |                    S² is a type variable
   |          .
