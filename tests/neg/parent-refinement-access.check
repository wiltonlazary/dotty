  |      error overriding value x in trait Year2 of type Int;
  |        value x in trait Gen of type Any has weaker access privileges; it should be public
  |      (Note that value x in trait Year2 of type Int is abstract,
  |      and is therefore overridden by concrete value x in trait Gen of type Any)
