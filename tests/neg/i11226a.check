-- [E007] Type Mismatch Error: tests/neg/i11226a.scala:12:48 -----------------------------------------------------------
12 |  def test(a: ActorRef): Unit = bus.unsubscribe(a) // error
   |                                                ^
   |               Found:    (a : ActorRef)
   |               Required: Unsubscriber.this.bus.Subscriber
   |
   |               Note that I could not resolve reference Unsubscriber.this.bus.Subscriber.
   |               Subscriber exists as a member of the self type ActorEventBus of trait ManagedActorClassification
   |               but it cannot be called on a receiver whose type does not extend trait ManagedActorClassification
   |
