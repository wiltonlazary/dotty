  |            Overloaded or recursive method f needs return type

  |            The error occurred while trying to compute the signature of method f
  |              which required to type the right hand side of method f since no explicit type was given
  |              which required to compute the signature of method g
  |              which required to type the right hand side of method g since no explicit type was given
  |              which required to compute the signature of method h
  |              which required to type the right hand side of method h since no explicit type was given
  |              which required to compute the signature of method i
  |              which required to type the right hand side of method i since no explicit type was given
