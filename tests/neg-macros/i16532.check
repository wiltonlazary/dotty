  |             ^^^^^^^^^
  |access to method recurseII from wrong staging level:
  | - the definition is at level 0,
  | - but the access is at level 1.

  |Hint: Staged references to inline definition in quotes are only inlined after the quote is spliced into level 0 code by a macro. Try moving this inline definition in a statically accessible location such as an object (this definition can be private).
