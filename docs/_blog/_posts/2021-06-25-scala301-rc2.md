This post is a quick announcement of Scala 3.0.1-RC2. This is the second release candidate for 3.0.1. The reason for this release is that a regression with respect to 3.0.0 was introduced by PR [#12519](https://github.com/scala/scala3/pull/12519) which caused the compiler to fail where it shouldn't. We have fixed this regression in PR [#12827](https://github.com/scala/scala3/pull/12827) and backported it to 3.0.1. This is the main reason for having 3.0.1-RC2 before 3.0.1 which is due in one week.

Besides this main change, taking advantage of the fact that RC2 is happening, we have also included various SBT reporting improvements (PR [#12845](https://github.com/scala/scala3/pull/12845)) which should improve interaction with [Metals](https://scalameta.org/metals/). Also we've backported a few infrastructural fixes even though they aren't a regression from 3.0.0.
