Scala 3 does NOT guarantee source compatibility between different minor language versions (e.g. some syntax valid in 3.x might get deprecated and then phased out in 3.y for y > x). There are also some syntax structures that were valid in Scala 2 but are not anymore in Scala 3. However the compiler provides a possibility to specify the desired version of syntax used in a particular file or globally for a run of the compiler to make migration between versions easier.

The default Scala language syntax version currently supported by the Dotty compiler is [`3.2`](https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/scala/runtime/stdLibPatches/language$$3/2$.html). There are also other language versions that can be specified instead:

- [`3.0-migration`](https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/scala/runtime/stdLibPatches/language$$3/0-migration$.html): Same as
`3.0` and `3.1`, but with a Scala 2 compatibility mode that helps moving Scala 2.13 sources over to Scala 3. In particular, it

    - flags some Scala 2 constructs that are disallowed in Scala 3 as migration warnings instead of hard errors,
    - changes some rules to be more lenient and backwards compatible with Scala 2.13
    - gives some additional warnings where the semantics has changed between Scala 2.13 and 3.0
    - in conjunction with `-rewrite`, offer code rewrites from Scala 2.13 to 3.0.

- [`3.0`](https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/scala/runtime/stdLibPatches/language$$3/0$.html), [`3.1`](https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/scala/runtime/stdLibPatches/language$$3/1$.html): the default set of features included in scala versions `3.0.0` to `3.1.3`.
- [`3.2`](https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/scala/runtime/stdLibPatches/language$$3/2$.html): the same as `3.0` and `3.1`, but in addition:
  - [stricter pattern bindings](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/changed-features/pattern-bindings.html) are now enabled (part of `future` in earlier `3.x` releases), producing warnings for refutable patterns. These warnings can be silenced to achieve the same runtime behavior, but in `future` they become errors and refutable patterns will not compile.
  - [Nonlocal returns](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/dropped-features/nonlocal-returns.html) now produce a warning upon usage (they are still an error under `future`).
- [`3.2-migration`](https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/scala/runtime/stdLibPatches/language$$3/2-migration$.html): the same as `3.2`, but in conjunction with `-rewrite`, offer code rewrites from Scala `3.0/3.1` to `3.2`.
- [`future`](https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/scala/runtime/stdLibPatches/language$$future$.html): A preview of changes that will be introduced in `3.x` versions after `3.2`.
Some Scala 2 specific idioms are dropped in this version. The feature set supported by this version may grow over time as features become stabilised for preview.

- [`future-migration`](https://scala-lang.org/api/3.x/scala/runtime/stdLibPatches/language$$future-migration$.html): Same as `future` but with additional helpers to migrate from `3.2`. Similarly to the helpers available under `3.0-migration`, these include migration warnings and optional rewrites.

There are two ways to specify a language version :

- with a `-source` command line setting, e.g. `-source 3.0-migration`.
- with a `scala.language` import at the top of a source file, e.g:

```scala
package p
import scala.language.`future-migration`

class C { ... }
```

Language imports supersede command-line settings in the source files where they are specified. Only one language import specifying a source version is allowed in a source file, and it must come before any definitions in that file.

**Note:** The [Scala 3 Migration Guide](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/guides/migration/compatibility-intro.html) gives further information to help the Scala programmer moving from Scala 2.13 to Scala 3.
