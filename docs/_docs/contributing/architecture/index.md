This chapter of the guide describes the architecture and concepts of `dotc`,
the Scala 3 compiler, including answers to questions such as:
- "What are the transformations that happen to my code?"
- "How do I run a compiler programatically?"
- "What are symbols, denotations, names and types?"
- "What is a compiler phase?"
- "What is the compiler Context?"

and many more.
