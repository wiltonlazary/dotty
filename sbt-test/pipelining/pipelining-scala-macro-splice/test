# m defines a macro, depending on a.A, defined in upstream project a
# however because m also tries to run the macro in the same project,
# a/A.class is not available yet, so a reflection error will occur.
# This is caught by the compiler and presents a pretty diagnostic to the user,
# suggesting to disable pipelining in the project defining A.
