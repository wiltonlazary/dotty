# Only B.scala should be recompiled. Previously, this lead to a subsequent
# compilation round because context bounds were desugared into names unique to
# the whole compilation unit, and in the first `compile` the two context bounds
# of B.scala were desugared into `evidence$2` and `evidence$1` in this order
# (because the definitions were visited out of order), but in the second call
# to `compile` we traverse them in order as we typecheck B.scala and ended up
# with `evidence$1` and `evidence$2` instead.
